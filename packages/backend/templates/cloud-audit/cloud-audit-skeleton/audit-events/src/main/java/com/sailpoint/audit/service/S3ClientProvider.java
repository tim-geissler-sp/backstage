    // From AWS's documents:
    //   By default, the SDK will attempt to reuse HTTP connections as long as possible. In failure situations where a
    //   connection is established to a server that has been brought out of service, having a finite TTL can help with
    //   application recovery. For example, setting a 15 minute TTL will ensure that even if you have a connection
    //   established to a server that is experiencing issues, youâ€™ll reestablish a connection to a new server within
    //   15 minutes. ... Tuning this setting down (together with an appropriately-low setting for Java's DNS cache TTL)
    //   ensures that your application will quickly rotate over to new IP addresses when the service begins announcing
    //   them through DNS, at the cost of having to reestablish new connections more frequently. By default, it is
    //   set to {@code -1], i.e. connections do not expire.
    // Setting this to 2 minutes to support recovery of any kind and to allow open TCP sockets to loosely scale with
    // load being processed by the Java process.
